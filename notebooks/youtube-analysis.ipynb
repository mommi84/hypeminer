      "\n",

      "[BITCOIN] with a hundred percent [BITCOIN] is over here so risk maximum annual loss is somewhere around.\n",

      "today we're not seeing a lot of movement we have only about 12 or 13 cryptos that are actually up and cardano is one of them but the majority of cryptos are slightly in the red even [BITCOIN] slightly in the red a lot of cryptos just not moving much.\n",

      "\n",
      "and he is probably going to move over and focus really on his decentralized exchange for [BITCOIN] now.\n",

      "a lot going into ethereum too not nearly as much as [BITCOIN] but a lot going into ethereum still multi-asset 9.1.\n",

      "now of course i'm not a financial advisor this is going to fall down faster than something like ethereum or [BITCOIN] if there is a bear market.\n",

      "we have [BITCOIN] up 0.02.\n",
      "\n",

      "now they want to offer [BITCOIN] backed loans.\n",

      "but they don't want to use [BITCOIN] as collateral they actually want to use synthetic products like futures.\n",

      "\n",
      "but i definitely think it will push up especially if they can get this figured out if the concurrency issue is solved and multiple people can transact on uh decks at one time that would be huge and it would push up the price especially if the rest of the market goes up in price now of course if [BITCOIN] goes down to 50 000 over the next week.\n",

      "okay [BITCOIN].\n",

      "he called buying [BITCOIN] as unethical as harvesting freshly uh freshly harvested baby brains.\n",
      "\n",
      "that's how much he hates [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "or there's jealous of the tremendous gains that people have made right [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "that's all from [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "well let's talk about fundamentals of [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "right the public trade companies that continue to buy more and more and more and hold more and more and more because they are that confident about [BITCOIN] in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "we've heard of miners selling a lot of [BITCOIN] because they're trying to pay for the operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "they just added another 256 [BITCOIN]s to their reserve they mined 256 [BITCOIN]s in november all november.\n",
      "\n",
      "now they hold 5242 [BITCOIN]s right.\n",
      "\n",
      "they're not selling anything and not only that they're taking a loan against their [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "so this five five thousand two thousand five thousand two hundred forty two [BITCOIN]s they're using that as collateral and borrowing more money and using that to buy more miners and minting or cr mining more [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "how much [BITCOIN]s they they hold has gone up and.\n",
      "\n",
      "one [BITCOIN] miner terawolf raises 200 million in debt at equity guess why right they're raising that because they want to expand and add more miners they're basically following the same footsteps of michael sailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "so it's funny every single miner is doing this you know um basically selling stock or bonds or borrowing against their [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "help contribute securing the [BITCOIN] network and michael saylor argues that every single time a miner goes public it makes [BITCOIN] stronger so this is a giant piece of [BITCOIN]'s fundamentals right uh the hash rate now has almost fully recovered since the china banned back in may june july.\n",
      "\n",
      "half the hash power of [BITCOIN] was pushed out of one country distributed across the world and now months later we have basically fully recovered from that because of these miners in north america and miners across the world that continue this arms race to solve this [BITCOIN] equation and to accumulate as many [BITCOIN]s as they can right so the fundamentals of [BITCOIN] one of the big fundamentals of [BITCOIN] [BITCOIN] mining hash rate securing the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "so if you're worried about [BITCOIN] short term just know that [BITCOIN] short term can be volatile.\n",
      "\n",
      "so that's what i want to talk about with [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "there's a couple other things i want to talk about today if you're looking at live coin watch [BITCOIN] dominance is still below 40.\n",
      "\n",
      "i know that [BITCOIN] came down a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "the rest of the all points came down a little bit but the ratio of all coins to [BITCOIN] did not go down in fact it stayed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "and i bring this up all the time when [BITCOIN] dominance does not shoot up that means generally retail investors like you.\n",
      "\n",
      "and i are not panic selling when there's true blood in the street when there's true panic [BITCOIN] dominance.\n",
      "\n",
      "or you buy low so that is a very very important metric that will continue to show [BITCOIN] dominance did not go up at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "right now is more deflationary than [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "it's lower than [BITCOIN]s right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "somewhere in the article it shows that ethereum's inflation rate right now is about 0.86 percent compared to [BITCOIN]s about 1.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "so if you look at it that way it's actually more deflationary than [BITCOIN] although ethereum does not have set.\n",
      "\n",
      "cap [BITCOIN] does right.\n",
      "\n",
      "yet and when you have doubt zoom out because you'll see that [BITCOIN] is doing just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "and we're still stuck in this channel which is actually a good thing because when [BITCOIN] is ready to go it could really go afterwards but remember focus on the fundamentals focus on the future and have patience all right lastly before i get into q.\n",
      "\n",
      "argue that [BITCOIN] may have not gone up this much at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "and uh all the billionaires causing a whole bunch of commotion and putting their money into [BITCOIN] right.\n",
      "\n",
      "so you could argue that had we not had a pandemic [BITCOIN] wouldn't be as big as is now right.\n",
      "\n",
      "it's [BITCOIN] for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "but the one thing that will last the test of time is [BITCOIN] so that is the reason why how do you feel about clover finance their bid for a pair chain auction.\n",
      "\n",
      "that's what you need to have um when it comes to [BITCOIN] and.\n",
      "\n",
      "what happened with [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "let's just start with [BITCOIN] and.\n",
      "\n",
      "i mean equities market was plus 400 500 went down to like negative 260 and [BITCOIN] came down with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "but the good thing is despite [BITCOIN] coming back down this.\n",
      "\n",
      "a day right [BITCOIN] is still holding uh unfortunately it stopped us once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "we're also going to have a christmas uh like no other because a [BITCOIN] we've been waiting for four years four long years okay outside of 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "right so there are some good movers but overall today still a lot of red because of [BITCOIN] coming down.\n",
      "\n",
      "100 square mostly to convert it into a crypto play into a [BITCOIN] plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "right without actually just calling it you know [BITCOIN] square or something like that like.\n",
      "\n",
      "warren buffett said [BITCOIN] is rap poison squirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "and you know that his life mission now is to basically integrate crypto [BITCOIN] payments uh even nfts and everything all into this one company called block right and.\n",
      "\n",
      "i think it's going to be bullish for [BITCOIN] in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "and also i saw this travis king kling excuse me highlighted all the significant stuff that happened in november despite most people concentrating on the fact that oh [BITCOIN] didn't skyrocket in november.\n",
      "\n",
      "oh [BITCOIN] didn't hit 98 000.\n",
      "\n",
      "this is why there's no fear right now uh being in [BITCOIN] and in crypto because the big money has already started.\n",
      "\n",
      "people are bashing november being a bad month for [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "right now i guess it's because [BITCOIN] decided to go down.\n",
      "\n",
      "a few days ago right [BITCOIN] was about to come above 60 thousand today.\n",
      "\n",
      "[BITCOIN] tanked equities market tanked everything tanked and this was already.\n",
      "\n",
      "and we are going to see [BITCOIN] and crypto go higher in december in my opinion and according to my sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "and [BITCOIN] is looking pretty darn good today and all coins are looking even better.\n",
      "\n",
      "and i do believe one of the things to expect is [BITCOIN] is going to head to a hundred thousand dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "so you can see that [BITCOIN] is a little bit higher than yesterday 58 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "but i do believe that is the path for [BITCOIN] in december.\n",
      "\n",
      "a lot of [BITCOIN] got set packed by a couple of things.\n",
      "\n",
      "i mentioned about it being the most bullish one just check out the history of [BITCOIN] in december.\n",
      "\n",
      "but whatever [BITCOIN] is set set to go higher and and not just because it's the last year of the month.\n",
      "\n",
      "everything else that i can show you about [BITCOIN] right is pointing upwards all the metrics the fundamentals adoption usage and global awareness attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "no there's just a lot of things going for [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "and uh besides [BITCOIN] if you check out the rest of the market outstanding outstanding um you know ethereum is closing in at its new high uh binance coin.\n",
      "\n",
      "is wrong and this is tracking uh this is tracking [BITCOIN] since 2010 all the way until now right looking at the [BITCOIN] circuit supply the the having events the total supply putting all that together.\n",
      "\n",
      "he made that prediction utilizing his floor model and that was back when [BITCOIN] was 30 000..\n",
      "\n",
      "and he could still be right for december which he predicted with his floor model that [BITCOIN] will be at 135 000 which is not too far off from his hundred thousand prediction with stock to flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "so i still believe this is in play now uh outside of plan b tech dev interesting looking at the eight hour uh time frame for [BITCOIN] looking at a couple things.\n",
      "\n",
      "of course a important indicator for whether or not [BITCOIN] is oversold or over bought right and putting it all together putting it all together.\n",
      "\n",
      "they're very very very heavily involved with [BITCOIN] and very uh they're very bullish on [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "they have their custodial service they have their trading desk too for institutions and now they are launching a spot [BITCOIN] etf in canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "already has three spot [BITCOIN] etfs purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "but fidelity is even a bigger name so this could bring even more attention and more money to [BITCOIN] and institutional investors that want to invest in [BITCOIN] without worrying about custody service and all that stuff.\n",

      "the sec didn't allow a [BITCOIN] spot etf to be approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "but you know what grayscale tells that well at least their lawyer uh tells uh over twitter that they don't think that sec has any leg to stand on the fact that they approve [BITCOIN] futures etfs but not spot etfs that's a big no-no.\n",
      "\n",
      "well we could see a [BITCOIN] spot etf in the us in the near future probably not this month but maybe early 2022 in january or february.\n",
      "\n",
      "these [BITCOIN] futures etfs launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "is that they're afraid that you know [BITCOIN] is still too manipulative or people are manipulating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "but still uh you know we have [BITCOIN] futures out.\n",
      "\n",
      "we have [BITCOIN] futures etf.\n",
      "\n",
      "i mean and [BITCOIN] is worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "so [BITCOIN] is mature.\n",
      "\n",
      "again uh if we do get a [BITCOIN] spot etf.\n",
      "\n",
      "that means stuff like this because i think jack dorsey really really really wants to utilize square not only to grow it but grow it into a crypto payment system right cash app which allows you to buy [BITCOIN] right now upgraded so that it supports tap root which is the newest upgrade for [BITCOIN] which has increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "but we know that square itself with all the terminals and dongles out there they haven't opened up [BITCOIN] payments yet or crypto payments.\n",

      "\n",
      "he has a whole team in fact that he hired he's paying out of pocket just to work on [BITCOIN].\n",

      "\n",
      "lastly in croatia if you're from croatia this will be a big positive their largest supermarket now accepts [BITCOIN] and xrp surprising enough not just [BITCOIN] and xrp.\n",
      "\n",
      "one ready for december ready for [BITCOIN] at a hundred thousand dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "but the biggest one of the biggest mistakes i had was when [BITCOIN] fell down to 3 100.\n",
      "\n",
      "you know it's one of those situations you know [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "is not gonna go much lower when [BITCOIN] fell to 3100 in uh 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "hold good amount of [BITCOIN] and all coins you'll be fine but a lot of times.\n",
      "\n",
      "oh i go all into all coins if there's a correction you go hate yourself because all coins also correct a lot worse than [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "[BITCOIN] is coming back.\n",
      "\n",
      "well that's why i'm here to address and also talk about why they rallied in the first place and of course i have to talk about [BITCOIN] which seemed like it was going to shatter 60 000 this morning and came a little bit down.\n",
      "\n",
      "[BITCOIN] looks like it wants to break out.\n",
      "\n",
      "dow dropped 600 points immediately right after that and also [BITCOIN] fell down from about 59.3 down right.\n",
      "\n",
      "so this is why i say this is a big endorsement for [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "this is the reason why people the billionaires out there and investment companies and hedge funds why they buy [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "i should say institutions uh why they're buying [BITCOIN] as a hedge as as a hedge right against inflation as a store of value and why no one is really buying gold these days because gold has not been a good hedge for the last decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "maybe yes it's not that all that good because people panic sold everything equities and [BITCOIN] and brought it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "but long term you know this is fantastic for [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "this is why people hold [BITCOIN] and why it will continue to rally and.\n",
      "\n",
      "this is what i always stress every single day whenever [BITCOIN] comes down a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "michael saylor accumulated uh 120 000 [BITCOIN]s for microstrategy that's never going to come back on the market ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "and he himself holds 20 000 [BITCOIN]s and that's just one man and one company.\n",
      "\n",
      "you how healthy [BITCOIN] is and how how it go higher because this simple is simply a supply and demand right.\n",
      "\n",
      "and then you look at this [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "if you're a [BITCOIN] holder if you're a crypto holder i don't think you have anything to worry about today's little dip.\n",
      "\n",
      "if inflation fears uh you know is real then why would you not get into [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "so that's [BITCOIN] but.\n",
      "\n",
      "you could see how it's only five percent away from its previous high while [BITCOIN] is still about 16.5 percent away.\n",
      "\n",
      "so you do have some good movers today and solana also is in the green despite the fact that they have been in red so for some time they seem like they want to flip and they were up more significantly when [BITCOIN] was above around 59 000.\n",
      "\n",
      "what's telling is [BITCOIN] dominance dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "now it's come up a little bit but still this shows you from yesterday to the day [BITCOIN] dominance dropped about a half percent a little bit more and every time [BITCOIN] dominance drops down that means that the all coins are getting stronger and why are all coins getting stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "which is why the dominance of all coin dominance are going up versus [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "of course they have [BITCOIN] and ethereum.\n",
      "\n",
      "and gracio holds about 640 000 [BITCOIN]s now.\n",

      "they're trying to convert the [BITCOIN] trust into a [BITCOIN] etf at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "you know what i think [BITCOIN] has a real shot to just get right back to where it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "so i think that [BITCOIN] can recover from this.\n",
      "\n",
      "do you think realistically [BITCOIN] can get to a hundred thousand by a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "so [BITCOIN] was doing very good.\n",

      "[BITCOIN] is slowly coming back from this you know panic dump or panic cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "are rallying [BITCOIN] diamonds has dropped so things are looking good.\n",
      "\n",
      "they feel like it's too big kind of like [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "so what's going on with uh what's going on [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "you can see right now [BITCOIN]'s just not doing not doing much right now 563 about the same same as this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "you could see that [BITCOIN] is still in this channel right.\n",
      "\n",
      "is you could see and during september when [BITCOIN] fell down to 40 000 and this is the point where a lot of people thought that [BITCOIN] was going to fall back down the 30s.\n",
      "\n",
      "all indications all indicators all metrics indicate that [BITCOIN] is about to go up.\n",
      "\n",
      "we could definitely see that big boom upwards which is interesting because i felt like today something like held [BITCOIN] back because the equities market was actually doing pretty good today except [BITCOIN] which was weird right.\n",
      "\n",
      "and you could see that during the last few times or [BITCOIN] went down when they had that breather.\n",
      "\n",
      "and then you see [BITCOIN] go up in a big way so over here.\n",
      "\n",
      "back in july right when [BITCOIN] fell back down to about thirty thousand.\n",
      "\n",
      "this was when [BITCOIN] fell down to about forty thousand.\n",
      "\n",
      "but anyways so that's [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "right there's a lot of things going for [BITCOIN] now what about.\n",
      "\n",
      "what about number two on the list besides [BITCOIN] what about ethereum.\n",
      "\n",
      "it's down only three percent versus [BITCOIN] seven percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "but i do feel like they have a lot of room to grow just like [BITCOIN] unfortunately unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "a lot of people are looking at other chains right now and completely off the east bandwagon which i think is a mistake because i think everyone should hold on some [BITCOIN] and hold on some ethereum at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "and you guys know tech dev is famous for fractal patterns and he has made many comparing [BITCOIN] to 2017 cycle here's one where he's comparing either 2021 versus 2017..\n",
      "\n",
      "and there's other things that i don't even have in terms of companies that's starting to buy ethereum as a as a alternative you know to to [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "i believe if [BITCOIN] goes higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "you know there's a lot you could already use cards like from criminal.com or from blockfi like their fully fledged um uh credit card [BITCOIN] rewards credit card.\n",
      "\n",
      "um sheba what do you think sam asks i'm 75 e 25 in [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "i think you need to distribute a little more if you're going to be holding just ethan [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "gotta wait for [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "much much better [BITCOIN] is nearing 59 000.\n",
      "\n",
      "so let's talk about [BITCOIN] and its next move where is that heading to and also breaking news.\n",
      "\n",
      "[BITCOIN] well maybe a whole lot so thanks for tuning in as always smash the like subscribe to the channel two streams almost every day 11 30 and 8 30 p.m center.\n",
      "\n",
      "and of course [BITCOIN] started coming back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "so last night you could see that [BITCOIN] bounced off of what this this uh 5354 bounced up to about 57 and then kind of calmed down around.\n",
      "\n",
      "i've been showing you guys this for a few days now that [BITCOIN] currently is stuck in this you know ascending uh with a channel not wedge channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "and you can see higher lows higher highs and discontinues forward where will [BITCOIN] end up.\n",
      "\n",
      "i mean if you look at previous times when [BITCOIN] went from thirty thousand twenty eight thousand thirty thousand it went up.\n",
      "\n",
      "but that round there is around seventy thousand dollars so [BITCOIN]s next stop could be around seventy thousand dollars once it shatters through 68 once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "or maybe we don't get any correction we just blow through here because let's not forget we are entering december the last month of the year last month of the four year cycle this traditionally is the most bullish month of any any time for not only just equities market but also for [BITCOIN] right even outside a four year cycle traditionally december.\n",
      "\n",
      "hey i don't care what [BITCOIN] is i'm just going to keep buying and buying and buying he's dollar cost averaging over the long haul even when the price is going up.\n",
      "\n",
      "so michael saylor and microstrategy just purchased another 7002 [BITCOIN]s for 414 million now.\n",
      "\n",
      "okay he purposely buys high because if [BITCOIN] comes down like.\n",
      "\n",
      "but anyways uh he's holding 121 000 [BITCOIN]s right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "uh where [BITCOIN] is right now right.\n",
      "\n",
      "so overall microstrategy holds over seven billion dollars worth of [BITCOIN] right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "why is a significant for [BITCOIN] though.\n",
      "\n",
      "okay you might be thinking so what who cares about jack what does twitter have to do with [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "but has been talking about how he wants to make his life mission basically around [BITCOIN] that if he wasn't ceo of twitter and square he would be a hundred percent in [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "so now frees up half his time to work on [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "he is already working on many things in terms of like a [BITCOIN] wallet [BITCOIN] decks.\n",
      "\n",
      "he just came out of the white paper for some kind of [BITCOIN] decks and of course he's helping lightning network grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "and he's just basically all in on [BITCOIN] right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "but what he's really interested in is helping [BITCOIN] become a global currency not just a reserve but global currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "he thinks [BITCOIN] can become the daily uh the the the internet currency of the world being used daily by billions of people.\n",

      "\n",
      "no because [BITCOIN] is superior in every way so hopefully that helps you answer.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "we know what pushed [BITCOIN] down this time was not due to whale manipulation was due to one new variant that came out.\n",

      "\n",
      "is that calm before the storm where if the equities market and these new cases turn out to be basically nothing we're going to see a pretty significant rally and [BITCOIN] could be right back to about 59 60 000 in short order.\n",

      "but i think this this week will be a good recovery week for the equities market and for [BITCOIN] and all coins.\n",
      "\n",
      "but i think i think this week will be good for [BITCOIN] and crypto.\n",
      "\n",
      "but they have introduced something that i believe all other exchanges will start doing in the future and that is to sell [BITCOIN] based on sets and not a decimal point.\n",
      "\n",
      "uh [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "and i think in the future that is definitely what's going to happen as [BITCOIN] gets bigger and bigger and bigger.\n",
      "\n",
      "no one wants to go on an app and buy a decimal fractional piece of [BITCOIN] they rather see that they're buying thousands of sats.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes if [BITCOIN] continues to run i think they will.\n",
      "\n",
      "then the market is going to recover in a big way and that includes [BITCOIN] and stocks and everything else because stocks also took a huge dive not as big as [BITCOIN] but also took a big dive uh on friday and.\n",

      "and if stocks was open 24 7 like [BITCOIN] they would have taken more dives um but we'll see what happens this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "[BITCOIN] could recover really really quickly if this turns out to be nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes i do believe that right i do believe it because you know the 50 of [BITCOIN] a lot of people don't care about and think like.\n",
      "\n",
      "but like days like today that helps you because [BITCOIN] is down barely two percent but some of the all the all coins are down five six ten percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "right a little bit less than [BITCOIN] more in big caps or a little bit less than small caps more in [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "a lot dan says [BITCOIN] back to 58k uh tonight that would not surprise me.\n",
      "\n",
      "i think this week is gonna be good for [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "we're all george so huge [BITCOIN] bounce it was expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "so let's discuss this [BITCOIN] bounce and the reason for it and.\n",
      "\n",
      "it's not rocket science why [BITCOIN] bounced up.\n",
      "\n",
      "this prompted [BITCOIN] to fall down from nearly 60 thousand.\n",
      "\n",
      "it's no surprise that [BITCOIN] is also recovering.\n",
      "\n",
      "but it bounced up pretty significantly to where it is now 57-4 which is higher than just a few days ago when [BITCOIN] was still hovering around 55-56.\n",
      "\n",
      "which means that tomorrow we could see [BITCOIN] back up to 60 000 in no time.\n",
      "\n",
      "and i expect the same thing for [BITCOIN] we're at 57 3..\n",
      "\n",
      "tomorrow it would not be unreasonable to wake up and see [BITCOIN] at 60 000 or even above trying to break through.\n",
      "\n",
      "can [BITCOIN] pump up from where it is now to 98 000 probably not probably not.\n",
      "\n",
      "so let's see where [BITCOIN] ends up.\n",
      "\n",
      "i've shown you guys this over last few days about this channel that [BITCOIN]s in right.\n",
      "\n",
      "and it held [BITCOIN] held i told you guys about the rsi level versus these previous lows at uh about 28 29 000 and also here about 40 000.\n",
      "\n",
      "right so [BITCOIN] is in this channel where it's forming higher lows and higher highs.\n",
      "\n",
      "and uh the rsi did show that it was ready to bounce and of course the lower channel held and what's great about this is if this continues onwards where is [BITCOIN] going to head.\n",
      "\n",
      "next well if you look at the top of this channel you know [BITCOIN] went from what 30 000.\n",
      "\n",
      "'re probably gonna see [BITCOIN] reach about.\n",
      "\n",
      "but it's hard to ignore because just three no two days to go cnbc posted how [BITCOIN] enters another bear market.\n",
      "\n",
      "right so tomorrow they're gonna have another headline saying [BITCOIN] enters a bull market.\n",
      "\n",
      "realize that [BITCOIN] is just fine realize that this is temporary.\n",
      "\n",
      "it did this uh [BITCOIN] rallied 60 percent afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "and then you go back before right when [BITCOIN] was even lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "then uh [BITCOIN] went up 130 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "and here's another 120 million dollars transfer to bitfenix probably use for leverage to buy some [BITCOIN] and crypto.\n",
      "\n",
      "they're not doing that uh no one dares to short [BITCOIN] and crypto right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "i think burger i can't take credit for inventing that i stole that from kevin o'leary he used to call [BITCOIN] nothing burger before he could admit that he liked [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "but before he would say [BITCOIN] is nothing burger uh but i'm gonna stick with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "all the time wrapped luna um you have rap [BITCOIN] you have wrapped everything wrapped container.\n",
      "\n",
      "hey overall [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "that is why [BITCOIN] is recovering.\n",
      "\n",
      "so [BITCOIN] is still dipping down.\n",
      "\n",
      "so tonight i'm going to talk about which all coins are best to buy during this current [BITCOIN] dip and there are a lot of projects that i'm.\n",
      "\n",
      "um [BITCOIN] 54.2 a little bit lower than this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "so this will pass and [BITCOIN] will continue forward so that's.\n",
      "\n",
      "i'm sticking with [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "this morning i talked about how whales are still buying accumulating this also correlates with that if you look at the number of [BITCOIN]s that's residing on the exchanges the exchange reserves it keeps dipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "we're at a historic low for a number of [BITCOIN]s on exchanges um.\n",
      "\n",
      "you'll realize that [BITCOIN] is at 100 200 000..\n",
      "\n",
      "but it's getting scarcer [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "uh there is uh there is a city called central city in colorado that that is proposing to put 20 percent of reserves uh into [BITCOIN] that's pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "more and more people are paying attention to [BITCOIN] and crypto new york city.\n",
      "\n",
      "is really warming up to [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "but he made a bold statement saying he bought almost 10 million dollars worth of [BITCOIN] to eat at current levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "that's enough with [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "okay let's just get that out of the way ethereum is always good just like [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "well just look at [BITCOIN] if [BITCOIN] could do a four or five five.\n",
      "\n",
      "all these multipliers i come out with is based on what i think [BITCOIN] will do based on how high [BITCOIN] could go uh komodo.\n",
      "\n",
      "you get a hundred free dollars worth of [BITCOIN] once you make a deposit.\n",
      "\n",
      "i'll let you guys go overall [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "but overall it [BITCOIN]'s not done.\n",
      "\n",
      "[BITCOIN]'s not done.\n",
      "\n",
      "but tonight i want to talk about [BITCOIN] of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "should you buy or sell [BITCOIN] right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "but uh let's look at [BITCOIN] man [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "had a really really really good run until this one news hit this morning that kind of broke things you could see we were doing really well during thanksgiving [BITCOIN] was pumping up from 55 all the way up to about 60 000.\n",
      "\n",
      "so it wasn't just with [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "so this was not just a [BITCOIN] thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "should you buy or sell [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "should you buy or sell [BITCOIN] well in my opinion you buy when things are cheap when there's blood in the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "and honestly there's not that much blood in the streets uh because [BITCOIN] is where it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "[BITCOIN] will most likely be above 60 000 as the chart was indicating that there was just upwards movement until this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "i mean if it turns out to be a whole nothing burger uh the markets will recover fast very very fast and we know that [BITCOIN] is down right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "[BITCOIN] is what everyone is looking to get into right now there is correlations with the equities market.\n",
      "\n",
      "have started entering [BITCOIN] right now and you may not believe that on a day like today.\n",
      "\n",
      "but this is the reason why [BITCOIN] is as big as it is and and to kind of reassure you guys a little bit more about why i think this is a good buying opportunity i hardly bust out the charts.\n",
      "\n",
      "so from uh from a technical perspective [BITCOIN] is at a level that you know what uh was the bottom for this last two.\n",
      "\n",
      "you could clearly see that if you draw a trend line here and trend line here [BITCOIN] is in an upwards ascending channel right now and the last time that four in the bottom was right around 28 29 000..\n",
      "\n",
      "but [BITCOIN] is forming higher lows.\n",
      "\n",
      "and i drew rsi aligned in rsi which shows that last time [BITCOIN] was you know at 28.29.\n",
      "\n",
      "the rsi dropped about 34.35 same thing around here when [BITCOIN] fell to 40 000 right.\n",
      "\n",
      "could be the point where [BITCOIN] starts reversing up and starts bouncing up.\n",
      "\n",
      "but even looking at from this perspective if you zoom out a little bit [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "if they aren't here's the other thing that i think is good for [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "but if you think about it that's good for [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "which means that there's going to be more inflation and those that are not hedging against inflation with the likes of [BITCOIN] will will be the ones that that won't benefit right that that actually will hurt them.\n",
      "\n",
      "but those of us that hold [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "we know that that's actually a very good thing which is why so many people are turning to [BITCOIN] right and have turned to [BITCOIN] the last few years.\n",
      "\n",
      "but if it turns out to be nothing then you know what things will recover really really quickly so in my opinion is definitely not a sell moment when [BITCOIN] is down like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "but uh even uh president buchelli from el salvador just added a whole bunch of [BITCOIN]s he added another hundred today you know before he started out with just like 460.\n",
      "\n",
      "but i'm pretty sure michael will announce that he's buying more [BITCOIN] soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "so these guys will continue to buy and these are guys that we need to mimic in terms of having strong hands and believing in [BITCOIN] and.\n",
      "\n",
      "what it's going to bring and continue on moving forward um last thing no last two things [BITCOIN] as a as a fundamental kind of thing uh is showing that yeah it is being used [BITCOIN] overtakes value transfer over paypal and that's not an easy thing to do so despite the fact so many people are holding [BITCOIN] as a value store as a hedges in inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "of course you could see here when [BITCOIN] was stuck in the 30 000 for some time it did dip below sometimes if dipped to 10 but for the most part it stood at 20 before rallying up and the same thing over here back in october early october when [BITCOIN] dipped down to about 40 000 the grieving the the fear index also dropped about 20 before it start ralling up.\n",
      "\n",
      "you know what's doing well is uh [BITCOIN] is starting to come back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "but one thing i talked about this morning is [BITCOIN] dominance.\n",
      "\n",
      "but when there's true panic out there [BITCOIN] dominance goes up.\n",
      "\n",
      "otherwise there's no reason why [BITCOIN] dominance would be going down the only reason why is because people are taking advantage and buying their favor all coins the ones are down today like ethereum and binance coin and solana even cardano and even xrp and all these coins are down their dca into them and that is why [BITCOIN] dom is actually going down.\n",
      "\n",
      "let's see if more news come out and let's see what happens with [BITCOIN] and crypto.\n",
      "\n",
      "all right but to answer the question buy or sell [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "so if you're a [BITCOIN] holder if you're a crypto holder do not be fooled what happened recently actually has nothing to do with the wheels selling.\n",
      "\n",
      "and i explained it a couple of times this was artificial in my opinion due to this new uh coveted um coleman variant that caused a lot of scare and it wasn't just [BITCOIN] it was the entire equities market but had it not for that uh had it been where that that news wasn't released.\n",
      "\n",
      "i think [BITCOIN] will be well above 60 000 right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "it's exactly the one of the reasons why uh we should have taken advantage of the dip the last few days right uh because crypto and [BITCOIN] were especially all coins i should say were sky high now.\n",
      "\n",
      "and you can see back in april of 2020 when [BITCOIN] fell down drastically right.\n",
      "\n",
      "right then you noticed that back in april of 2021 the same thing occurred when [BITCOIN] actually fell down.\n",
      "\n",
      "uh this is supposedly the wallet of the third largest [BITCOIN] whale someone that has been accumulating quite tremendously since november and they just purchased another 105 [BITCOIN]s so they purchased 105 [BITCOIN] uh under the a few days ago and.\n",
      "\n",
      "okay uh this is something else that measures uh relative value to market value of [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "so this also indicates that yeah even though [BITCOIN] did dip a little bit the value that measures traditionally tops and bottoms utilizing this is at the point where [BITCOIN] was still uh below 20 000 right.\n",
      "\n",
      "how uh i guess the environment for [BITCOIN] is right now despite the fact that we came back down to 54.55.\n",
      "\n",
      "and that was when [BITCOIN] was still below 20 000..\n",
      "\n",
      "it's still 20 21 guys if we get that same kind of top at that point seven eight six level that puts [BITCOIN] around 140 to 150 000 so not as high as the 200 000 predictions that many have stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "and we're at fifty five thousand that kind of shows you how undervalued [BITCOIN] is right now right relative to where it will be if that's the next bottom at 60 000 right.\n",
      "\n",
      "all right uh outside of that outside of [BITCOIN] right looking at uh everything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "crypto all coins um [BITCOIN] dominance went down even lower than last night.\n",
      "\n",
      "i've talked about this a couple times when [BITCOIN] dominance goes down.\n",
      "\n",
      "that means that people have confidence and that means people are buying all coins that's why [BITCOIN] dominance goes down if [BITCOIN] goes up [BITCOIN] diamonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "that's when there's a lot of fear a lot of panic everyone is selling everything and going back to [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "they are right that is why [BITCOIN] diamonds continues to go down and today is a relatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "if [BITCOIN] is going to continue upwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "but it is pretty clear that [BITCOIN] were you know from the last three lows right.\n",
      "\n",
      "is uh where [BITCOIN] is right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "and that was when [BITCOIN] fell to like 2829 and also when it fell to about 39.40 and right now being where it is could be.\n",

      "\n",
      "uh once we hit that and [BITCOIN] becomes the most scarce asset in the uh on the planet i think that could be the moment when hyper [BITCOIN]ization or the super cycle will kick in in in a way that yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "we'll probably if you look at the for example the stock to flow model at the moment it uses [BITCOIN] prices uh expressed in dollars because dollar is the uh world's reserve currency everything is expressed in dollars but once [BITCOIN] hit that hits that that that hundred stock flow ratio and and becomes the best money in fact in the world i guess uh it's time to price everything in [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "uh but i could see a hyper[BITCOIN]ization in that sense a supercycle in that sense that [BITCOIN] becomes the de facto money and the denominator of all things valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "i understand the view as in and most technical people are having that view and and indeed the amount of of new [BITCOIN]s or the percentage of new [BITCOIN]s is is getting less and less and less of a factor in the market uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "and that's also um in line with stock to flow view of things that you have to view it like an investor an investor has alternative investments gold real estate equities et cetera and [BITCOIN] and the fact that when [BITCOIN] halves it's it's the the stock to flow ratio will double and it will put [BITCOIN] well next to um next to a real estate uh by then and next to gold by now so people are really comparing it to gold right now because it's as scarce and as gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah very little new [BITCOIN]s coming in the market and less and less by the way every halving and that the impact for example of exchanges selling their their fees is bigger than that or miners not even selling.\n",
      "\n",
      "and they're they're just counting for scarce assets and right now [BITCOIN] is comparable to gold and it will be comparable to real estate and that will that will be a big change in the eye of the investor.\n",
      "\n",
      "the [BITCOIN] price went up two x or three x or sometimes even more above the stock to flow levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "we could we could see 300k [BITCOIN] that that would not surprise me but after after the next all-time high we will uh fear will kick in and we will see lower [BITCOIN] price.\n",

      "you can enter this for free to win one ethereum or nine lifetime passes um so enter that via the video description gonna get right onto the [BITCOIN] chart.\n",

      "\n",
      "so what you can see here in blue's open interest and gray is the price chart of [BITCOIN] what you can see is essentially as the price has been rising open interest.\n",

      "\n",
      "how much is that worth and and then you have the network value and human potential value because people are building on this thing that's the three areas of value i see for [BITCOIN] the free money premium has been completely wiped out since 70 000..\n",
      "\n",
      "when i just forget about prices and look at the fundamental value of things so this is unique addresses the amount of people who are using the [BITCOIN] network still very positive.\n",

      "high conviction plays like [BITCOIN] and ethereum for me personally.\n",
      "\n",
      "right now is 1.8 percent that's around the same as [BITCOIN].\n",

      "it's the same as [BITCOIN].\n",

      "we're seeing that play out in the stock market and [BITCOIN] is becoming more correlated with that.\n",

      "[BITCOIN] is also rising and that just brings with it all all coins in the future though it's just about.\n",

      "\n",
      "so at this point [BITCOIN] is a meme the markets are mean so.\n",
      "\n",
      "and that at this point we have basically concluded that we do have in fact lengthening cycles and something that we've been speaking about on this channel for many many months that the [BITCOIN] cycles or the cryptocycles as a whole do get longer as time goes by due to changes in asset classes uh increased assets we have tons of different assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "so on so it does change the nature of the market but even with [BITCOIN] selloff we did see a major selloff and a sea of red across a variety of different coins even in the past 24 hours we can see most coins are down 20 25 uh 26 percent some even over 30 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "these 20 corrections are expected especially during a bull market we've had a 60 rise in the past few months without basically any corrections in [BITCOIN].\n",

      "possibly the beginning of 2022 see a trillion dollar [BITCOIN] again.\n",

      "just as i said but as we see from tech dev here every [BITCOIN] cycle in history has ended with a red month followed by two or three very green months now.\n",

      "\n",
      "it's just a fact at this point that most countries have trashed currencies so even though smaller countries and countries that you may not even care about are accepting [BITCOIN] as legal tender is actually very bullish news and very good for the crypto market as a whole.\n",

      "is that we don't necessarily have this pure fomo retail hype that is driving the value of ethereum or the value of [BITCOIN] we have economies being built in the in these ecosystems we have huge economies being built within ethereum for that matter even though the gas fees are so high even though people are complaining about this and slow transactions.\n",

      "of course facebook was the major catalyst to change the name to meta and increase this hype now judging sentiment we've got a ton of different tools that we can use for this and one of those is a google trends now you can use google trends for anything whether it's checking sentiment around [BITCOIN] whether it's checking sentiment around baby names whether it's checking sentiment about where the best holiday destinations in the world are which right now for me.\n",

      "it's actually a really good thing because if [BITCOIN] is currently sitting at what fifty eight thousand dollars fifty nine thousand dollars and fear is at thirty four.\n",

      "is it not is [BITCOIN] dropping to levels which might support an altcoin rally at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "so that's given us an idea because trading in all coins is a risky business and most people absolutely themselves when [BITCOIN] drops a few percent and they watch their all coins go down 10 or 15 percent.\n",

      "the ethereum ecosystem they're doing well against their btc values because [BITCOIN]'s holding up and ethereum is moving so you want to see them move against ethereum as well which we'll look at a couple in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "this is in the [BITCOIN] space.\n",
      "\n",
      "so if [BITCOIN] keeps going this looks like it's doing pretty well.\n",
      "\n",
      "but since the breakout about 25 against [BITCOIN] value so that's exactly what we want to see ocean again.\n",
      "\n",
      "but not much has been happening in that time because [BITCOIN] also went up ethereum's gone up.\n",
      "\n",
      "the last one here is roon and roon has been doing pretty well against [BITCOIN] making higher lows and higher highs against its usd value it's been doing pretty well also.\n",

      "flows by asset 1.1 million here out of ada polka dots getting money coming in solana's getting money coming in ethereum's getting money coming in [BITCOIN]'s getting money coming in.\n",
      "\n",
      "and it bounced around these levels accumulating again before it took off so this would be the play to increase the [BITCOIN] bags if it got down this low because we're pretty sure we should get a another move up from that level.\n",
      "\n",
      "but i would strongly urge you to keep an eye on this chart this ada btc chart in case your investment is not outperforming [BITCOIN] this thing needs to outperform [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "but at this point if you are buying it low you definitely want to see this go up against [BITCOIN] same deal with ada ether.\n",
      "\n",
      "that's why we hold ethereum over [BITCOIN] because this is the chart that ethereum is showing against [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "you don't want to see it break down from these levels so that would be my if then if ada breaks down from the 2000 or the .0002 level of eath it's probably not a good hold and the money is safer in ethereum speaking of which we look at [BITCOIN] and eth [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "but if it does then of course we could see this effect of the negativity in [BITCOIN] and the crypto space flow over into other cryptos and we'll probably see things like the metaverse and things that are really poppin continue to pop while uh not much is happening with [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "and of course this will just start continue to extend and lengthen the [BITCOIN] cycle because overall with [BITCOIN] we're still seeing an uptrend.\n",
      "\n",
      "but it doesn't mean we need to move to new all-time highs this month or last month or september for 300 000 [BITCOIN] so for my analysis and my planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "when i look to [BITCOIN] and of course the stock markets if these markets start to come down on the back of some of this crazy news with omicron variant coming out or any other sort of virus or anything that they're trying to do the view is still up therefore these times are to be buying the dip now my dip buying area on the 50 levels that's the the best times we get a nice balanced correction if it doesn't get that far.\n",
      "\n",
      "and so that's what i'm looking for here with [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "that's a nice level for some support coming in on [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "and then you probably see some strength come back to [BITCOIN] and start to break a little higher in the meantime while [BITCOIN] still remains above our 50 level and grinds away up down sideways whatever it may be people are getting bored and then moving across to altcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "so we want to get into stuff that is starting to move while [BITCOIN] still looks stable but not taking the gains away from everything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "and of course i work this in with my property cycle and of course checking out [BITCOIN] as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "what i see at the moment is the absolute bullishness of ethereum and even against [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "you can also see my retirement fund portfolio which has ethereum and [BITCOIN] in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "and i think i should be able to at least double this portfolio by the end of the bull run just holding [BITCOIN] and eth.\n",
      "\n",
      "so i'm starting with [BITCOIN] because i want to ensure that the bull market is still continuing there is a lot of talk about this being a potential double top or this being a fake.\n",
      "\n",
      "and you have a view that [BITCOIN] might get to 95 000 or 125 000.\n",
      "\n",
      "but we can produce road maps to give us an idea of maybe this will be a safer point to exit and give us an idea of maybe where price might start to find some resistance so with that all said which is going to apply to [BITCOIN] ethereum and.\n",
      "\n",
      "but i want to use this moving forward to give me some ideas for ethereum and whether ethereum can actually flip [BITCOIN] in the market standings in this cycle as well and to let you in a little secret i think it'll go very close.\n",
      "\n",
      "twenty thousand dollar [BITCOIN] in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "so it's about 100 110 percent then from that 42k [BITCOIN].\n",
      "\n",
      "so this isn't the overall range of [BITCOIN] of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "you know i think [BITCOIN] has that opportunity to at least get to 90 and around that 120 000..\n",
      "\n",
      "the flipping in terms of [BITCOIN] we need it at this current point to get to one point sorry 0.16 of a btc.\n",
      "\n",
      "so this is for eth now to flip [BITCOIN] halfway.\n",
      "\n",
      "the correction 55 for [BITCOIN] 65 for eth.\n",
      "\n",
      "that's a start from where i'm looking in terms of time frames based on history now to the all-important price the thing that everyone wants to know what price is this going to be remember the most important thing is a change in trend if the trend changes forget everything don't stick to a 300 000 [BITCOIN] by september.\n",
      "\n",
      "i'd love to be proved wrong because like you could see i'm holding a lot of heath and a lot of [BITCOIN] for that superannuation fund if it happens great.\n",
      "\n",
      "but we know when eth gets a run on it gets a pretty decent run on and it can double quite quickly so speaking of doubling the eighth btc chart to flip [BITCOIN] as it currently stands needs to double.\n",

      "that's if [BITCOIN] stays exactly where it is.\n",
